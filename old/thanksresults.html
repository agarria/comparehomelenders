        <p>CompareHomeLenders.com is not a banker or lender (Service Provider). The Service Providers in our lender network participate in our quote matching service and may have mortgage loan products available that match the criteria you submit in our secure online form. The information collected is not an application for credit or a mortgage loan, nor is it used to pre-qualify you with any Service Provider.</p>
        <p>This service is free and there is no cost to submit a quote request, get matched with service providers, and receive mortgage offers. Of course, you will be responsible for paying any closing costs, loan processing fees, or other fees directly to the lender that you choose to close your loan with. The rate and payment referenced on our site or in any advertisement is for guidance and is based on available rates and terms from our lender network.</p>
        <p>The interest rate, APR, and terms that you are offered may vary based on your mortgage loan request and are determined by the lenders that you are matched with. There is a possibility that you may not be matched with the particular service provider that is making this example offer. Advertised rates are subject to change daily without notice. Not available in all states.</p>
        <p>CompareHomeLenders.com does not offer its matching services in all states. Not all consumers will qualify for the advertised rates, programs and terms.</p>
